### Git 1.1: About Version Control 

#### Summary

VCS is an abbreviation for Version Control System. This can save every work that I perform in the document.
Therefore, if I want to look at my previous version of the document, I can go search them at any moment.
Thus, VCS is very useful to compare my works and collaborate with others.

#### Question

In order to write a normal document, not for the school, then can we still use github?
Or do we need another VCS to write a document for ourselves?
